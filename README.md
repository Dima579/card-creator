Greetings 

Thank you for viewing this project! It was made to show basic exposure/skills to php. It's features are the following:

- create a player card with a number of form inputs/options
- save card creations as images
- save the card as save file which can be uploaded to generate the card again

This project is now feature complete and may only recieve updates to reesovle bugs or structural adjustments, however in the future I may use this project as reference to develop a future full stack project.
